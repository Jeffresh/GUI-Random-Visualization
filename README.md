# GUI to visualize Pseudorandom number generators (PRNG).

### Abstract

Simple _GUI_ that allows the visualization of different random number generators. 
You can choose between different random generators (PRNG) and set different parameters like the seed 
and the length of the sequence which will be shown in the canvas represented as set of points, 
being able to see the variance of each one generator and consequently how good 
they are generating pseudorandom numbers.

### Introduction

The implementation is coded in _Java 8.0_ and the _GUI_ using the _framework_ _Swing_. 
The (PRNG) are implemented using lambda functions being easy to add new ones.
